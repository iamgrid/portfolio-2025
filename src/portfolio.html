		<p>IMPORTANT: These sample projects are primarily there to demonstrate to potential new clients that I can build elaborate applications that look nice and work well. As they are all open source you're also welcome to dig into their codebases to evaluate me as a developer. But if you decide to do the latter please remember: while I do my best to keep these apps in working condition, the technologies and methodologies I used will inevitably become long in the tooth and do not represent the state of the art in terms of how I build things <b>today</b>.</p>
